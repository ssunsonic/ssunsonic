### Welcome üåç!

I work as a Statistical Analyst for UC Davis [Datalab][link], performing various tasks such as data acquisition, training detection models, and leveraging new technologies. An aspiring Data Scientist/MLE, with goals of blending my academic and industrial experiences into something of meaningful value. 

My career plan is to work as a Data Analyst for a few years, understand the in and outs of how data-driven processes create valuable and productive cultures, and then transition. To showcase skills outside of my professional experience, I'm solving cases through the [8 Week SQL Challenge][sql] and plan on developing cool and intuitive visuals in form of dashboards, reports, or charts.

I'm currently very interested in computer vision + data visualization. When I'm not here, you can find me at the üèñ , on the pitch üí´, playing casual guitar, or anywhere with an affinity for delicious food. I'm inspired by those that chase relentless creative pursuits and please feel free to reach out!
