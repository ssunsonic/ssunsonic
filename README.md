### Welcome 🌍!

I am a current undergrad at UC Davis studying Statistics and Economics. I have developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling 🔢, ML theory, and certain branches of mathematics through courses, projects, and professional experience. Topics that I am currently interested in include LLMs, Data Visualization, and NLP.

In my free time you can find me at the 🏖 or on the pitch 💫.
