### Welcome 🌍!

I am a current undergrad at UC Davis studying Statistics and Economics. I have developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling 🔢, ML theory, and certains branches of mathematics through courses, projects, and certifications. Topics that I am currently interested in are: NLP (LLMs, Chatbots) and Neural Networks

In my free time you can find me at the 🏖 or on the pitch 💫.
